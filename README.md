# Random Quote Generator

The random quote generator allows the user to have an array of quotes that print to document.

It includes a function which randomly chooses and generates the HTML for the quote and a function to randomly select a new color to be used for the background.

A printQuote function prints the randomly selected quote into the webpage and changes the background color.

It will load a new quote upon page load and an interval has been added to load a new quote every 5 seconds.

The user may click the "Show Another Quote" button to see a new quote, which also resets the 5 second interval.
